Course Description: This course examines how films portray the health environment and the need for environmental protection. The course focuses on series of questions including: To what extent does a film suggest that the world has environmental concerns? What are the constraints that narrative form, production routines, financing and distribution put on representing environmental problems and environmentalists? Is the information in the film to be trusted? In documentaries, are physical and social scientists’ explanations of environmental problems and solutions reliable? What cues can we use from within and outside the film to evaluate the film for credibility? During the course participants will compare the science and economics of selected environmental issues with film presentations, examine what drives of environmental participation (and the limits of film in presenting science), and look at the constraints of producing special interest versus broad distribution films on presentations of the environment. Class includes viewing blockbuster, Oscar, and award-winning documentaries. Lecture attendance is mandatory.

Course Description: Clothing is a medium for fashioning identities from commodities, and it is hardly surprising that political and social tensions are embodied in its fabrications. The politics of dress indicates inseparable links between cultures, aesthetics, and politics, as demonstrated in debates about Muslim practices of veiling, the role of clothing in colonialism’s ""civilizing"" mission, immigrant and ""third world"" sweatshop labor, fashion policing and subcultural style, and the fashion and modeling industries. Clearly manifest throughout these politics is the role of gender, race, nation, and sexuality, as relations of power and as critical factors for social life and creative imagination. This course requires weekly written reflections on the required readings; a written midterm; and a final project, which can be either a research paper or a creative project. The course also requires in-class participation (which will include pop quizzes, group discussion, and other exercises) and one individual or group presentation.

Course Description: Offers a strategic perspective and examination on how the digital revolution is changing the marketing landscape. We will explore this new digital realm and discuss its revolutionary impact upon both firms and consumers. This exploration comes in two parts. In the first part (the first four weeks), we will explore how the digital revolution has affected our analog (or physical) world. Specifically, we will examine four ways in which the Analog World has been affected by the Digital Revolution: Domination, Resistance, Synergy, and Transformation. In the second part (the second four weeks), we will review the foundations of marketing (i.e., product, promotion, placement, and price) and examine how these foundations are being shifted by the rise of the digital revolution. In this portion of the course, we will explore a variety of new digital concepts and tools, including, customer co-creation, user-generated content, and 3D printing. This course will contain several examples of each of these concepts and explore their implications for both marketers and consumers. This course will also employ a variety of learning techniques, including video lectures, case studies, hands-on exercises, and interviews with leading marketing scholars. The learning approach will be highly interactive; you will have the opportunity to engage in a variety of hands-on activities and be a member of a rich learning community.

Course Description: All research is guided by theory. Theory provides a vocabulary, a set of laws or generalizations, a background literature, and a conceptual framework for any effort to plan, design, and execute a research study. There is no theory-free inquiry. This is true in the social sciences as well as the natural sciences. All research seeks to explain phenomena: a theory provides an explanation for those explanations. However, these theoretical assumptions are often implicit and unreflective. Researchers may think they have no theory, or have a theory that is so taken for granted that they don’t recognize it as an assumed theory. Much of educational research suffers from this lack of theoretical self-awareness. Like any other aspect of research, theories are falsifiable. They must stand the test of evidence – which may go against them. The goal of the class is not to identify the ""right"" or ""best"" theory, but to make the identification and selection of a theory more critical and reflective. Any major theory has insights, and each has limitations.

Course Description: Introduces students to a range of rapid prototyping techniques and methods to analyze needs, opportunities and design spaces. Students will work in teams to develop ideas for novel computational devices or applications to meet identified needs. Covers the interlinked entrepreneurial skills of identifying an unmet need, exploiting technological opportunities, exploring a design space to refine an idea, and communicating a design vision through demonstrations with prototypes and proofs of concept. This enables developers to show how their envisaged working interactive technology will be used productively in a particular real-life context. Communicating the vision of computational devices is a challenge because dynamic use in context is hard for people other than the device's developers to imagine. The ability to produce convincing, clear, powerful demonstrations even at the early stages of a project is a highly valuable entrepreneurial skill, and also highly applicable within an organization.

Course Description: The ultimate goal for data analytics in business is to obtain actionable insight. In this course, you will learn to use several tools—including the most important tool, your mind--for processing business data to gain that insight. You will perform tasks including extracting, transforming and loading (ETL) data to conducting exploratory data analytics (EDA). You will also gain experience in finding patterns in the data by using machine learning (ML) algorithms. You will develop a conceptual foundation for why ML algorithms are useful and how the resulting models from those algorithms are used to find actionable insight related to business problems. In the end, you will be equipped with the skillset to evaluate when an algorithm should be used and the ability to run these algorithms with R and RStudio and communicate the results using notebooks. Completion of this course requires downloading and using certain software on specific operation systems; details can be found in the course syllabus.

Course Description: In this course, we seek to make sense of the impacts of globalization. Is the freer flow of trade, people, and capital around the world responsible for the world's economic, social, and political ills, or are we inclined to say that, on balance, it is still a good thing? As more people become more connected across larger distances in different ways, are they following more of the same norms and growing aware of what they share, or are they more aware of cultural differences and see integration as a threat to social cohesion? Upon completion of this course, students should be able to demonstrate content expertise using both written and verbal communication skills. They will do so by: identifying the different drivers of the phenomenon widely described as globalization; distinguishing between the social, cultural, political, and economic processes of globalization and give examples of how they interact in specific and contingent ways; analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of further global integration; combining the different aspects of globalization into a coherent narrative; designing and defending their own alter-globalization campaign.

Course Description: Is it possible for a group of people to have secure human rights when the same rights are being denied to large groups of people based on their identity? This course takes a comparative survey approach to social movements of U.S. groups seeking to overcome discrimination across political, economic, and social spheres. The cases covered take place over the course of centuries and represent a wide range of racial, ethnic, and gender groups, but they also contain many similar ideological features rooted in social movement literature. A close study of these movements demonstrates that human rights are not freely recognized or bestowed, but must be achieved by struggle.

The goal is to introduce students to the philosophical, social, and relational dynamics of ""story"" among people as all human storyteller as well as organizations of all sizes across a wide spectrum of fields including library as storytelling organizations. It also aims to draw students to explore how a story foregrounds bridge-building dialog, affects the power of information, and thus maximize human potential. Students will be exposed to a range of opportunities to apply storytelling thinking as a tool to identify the audience, design means to communicate with them, and develop dynamic triangle of people sharing stories, engaging in constructive dialogs and reinterpreting etc.

Course Description: An introduction to the study of early African American literary and cultural production, ranging from the earliest writings by African descended people in British North America in the eighteenth century to the end of World War I. At each turn, we will situate texts in their cultural and historical contexts, attending not only to the specificity of a particular text's moment, but also to the forces of contingency and tradition at play in the construction of literary, cultural, and political communities. Throughout our discussions we will think about both the ""African-ness"" and ""American-ness"" of African American literature as collective and imaginative processes. Early African Americans wrote for a variety of reasons—philosophical, political, pleasurable, instrumental—and protesting slavery and racism was just one (albeit an important one) among many of those reasons. We will read letters, poems, sermons, songs, constitutions and bylaws for religious and civic organizations, stories, and texts that defy easy categorization. Writers may include Phillis Wheatley, David Walker, Maria Stewart, Frederick Douglass, Harriet Jacobs, Frances E.W. Harper, William Wells Brown, W.E.B. Du Bois, Pauline Hopkins, Charles Chesnutt, Paul Lawrence Dunbar, Alice Dunbar Nelson, and Ida B. Wells.

What kinds of production should be considered art? How are specific formal strategies informed by the perspectives of different subject positions? What politics underwrite them? We will consider, and reconsider, the existing narratives about art during this period with a dual aim: first, to better understand the historical positions of the artists in question, and, second, to piece together a prehistory of the moment in which we currently find ourselves.

Course Description: An introduction to the study of early African American literary and cultural production, ranging from the earliest writings by African descended people in British North America in the eighteenth century to the end of World War I. At each turn, we will situate texts in their cultural and historical contexts, attending not only to the specificity of a particular text's moment, but also to the forces of contingency and tradition at play in the construction of literary, cultural, and political communities. Throughout our discussions we will think about both the ""African-ness"" and ""American-ness"" of African American literature as collective and imaginative processes. Early African Americans wrote for a variety of reasons—philosophical, political, pleasurable, instrumental—and protesting slavery and racism was just one (albeit an important one) among many of those reasons. We will read letters, poems, sermons, songs, constitutions and bylaws for religious and civic organizations, stories, and texts that defy easy categorization. Writers may include Phillis Wheatley, David Walker, Maria Stewart, Frederick Douglass, Harriet Jacobs, Frances E.W. Harper, William Wells Brown, W.E.B. Du Bois, Pauline Hopkins, Charles Chesnutt, Paul Lawrence Dunbar, Alice Dunbar Nelson, and Ida B. Wells.

Course Description: Addresses the ways in which knowledge is represented, with special reference to the knowledge representations of teachers and learners. Its interdisciplinary bases are functional linguistics, semiotics, philosophy, history of ideas, media/communication studies, and ontology in computer science. The focal point of the course is the five questions about meaning posed by Cope and Kalantzis in their transpositional grammar: ""what is this about?"" (reference); ""who or what is doing this?"" (agency); ""what holds this together?"" (structure); ""how does this fit with its surroundings?"" (context); and ""what is this for?"" (interest). Along these lines of inquiry, a transpositional grammar addresses language, image, embodied action, object and space. ""Transposition"" refers to the movement across these various forms of meaning, intensified in the era of pervasively multimodal, digitally-mediated communications. Applied to education, not only does this provide a valuable heuristic to reframe literacy teaching and learning (the original impulse for the development of this grammar). It also offers an integrated account of meaning-to-learn across all subject areas, including pedagogical content knowledge and learner knowledge representations. Conceived in the broader terms of social-scientific research methods, transpositional grammar is an attempt to overcome the narrowness and logocentrism of ""the language turn"" which dominated social sciences in the twentieth century. In a practical sense, semiotics of the kind explored in this course also provides tools for reading and interpreting multimodal texts and research data.

Course Description: For several decades now, assessment has become an increasingly pressing education priority. Teacher and school accountability systems have come to be based on analysis of large-scale, standardized summative assessments. As a consequence, assessment now dominates most conversations about reform, particularly as a measure of teacher and school accountability for learner performance. Behind the often heated and at times ideologically gridlocked debates is a genuine challenge to address gaps in achievement between different demographically identifiable groups of students. There is an urgent need to lift whole communities and cohorts of students out of cycles of underachievement. For better or for worse, testing and public reporting of achievement is seen to be one of the few tools capable of clearly informing public policy makers and communities alike about how their resources are being used to expand the life opportunities for their children. This course is an overview of current debates about testing, and analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of a variety of approaches to assessment. The course also focuses on the use of assessment technologies in learning. It will explore recent advances in computer adaptive and diagnostic testing, the use of natural language processing technologies in assessments, and embedded formative assessments in digital and online curricula.

Course Description: Design thinking, a term with origins in industrial design practice, describes a human-centered approach to design and innovation in products and services, addressing the tri-partite requirements of feasibility, desirability and viability. With this focus on determining user needs, a variety of processes, including observation, empathy, ideation, prototyping and modeling, are used to discover people's needs and opportunities for design thinking, along with the communication of design outcomes by diagrammatic and narrative means. Design thinking is best done in teams, hence the project team basis for this course. This course concentrates on need-finding rather than the full resolution of design proposals.

Course Description: A study of social problems in the United States necessarily entails a discussion of global issues. To that end, this course will examine many contemporary social issues such as crime, war and terrorism, the environment, inequality, poverty, discrimination, the economic recession, and others, through a global framework. Many of the topics we will cover could motivate an entire semester's study in their own right; indeed, some scholars devote their entire careers to but one of these topics. However, this breadth allows us to think broadly about the issues that are identified as social problems and the ways in which individuals and groups attempt to resolve those problems; both processes are revealing about the time and society in which we live. One of the main objectives of this class is to learn about how sociologists examine social problems through analysis and research. Alongside that process, you will improve your critical thinking skills and become a better/more informed consumer of information.
